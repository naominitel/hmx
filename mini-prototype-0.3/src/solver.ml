       in the young pool must have rank less than or equal to the pool's
       number.)  These variables are also marked as ``young'', so as to
       be identifiable in constant time. *)

                          (string_of_int (Array.length sorted)))
    ) (inhabitants young_pool);

    (* Next, we update the ranks of the young variables. One goal is to ensure
       that if [v1] is dominated by [v2], then the rank of [v1] is less than or
       equal to the rank of [v2], or, in other words, that ranks are
       nonincreasing along any path down the structure of terms.  The second
       goal is to ensure that the rank of every young variable is exactly the
       maximum of the ranks of the variables that it dominates, if there are
       any.

       The process consists of several depth-first traversals of the forest
       whose entry points are the young variables. Traversals stop at old
       variables. Roughly speaking, the first goal is achieved on the way
       down, while the second goal is achieved on the way back up.

       During each traversal, every visited variable is marked as such, so as
       to avoid being visited again. To ensure that visiting every variable
       once is enough, traversals whose starting point have lower ranks must
       be performed first. In the absence of cycles, this enforces the
       following invariant: when performing a traversal whose starting point
       has rank [k], every variable marked as visited has rank [k] or less
       already. (In the presence of cycles, this algorithm is incomplete and
       may compute ranks that are slightly higher than necessary.) Conversely,
       every non-visited variable must have rank greater than or equal to
       [k]. This explains why [k] does not need to be updated while going
       down. *)

               If the variable has no structure, we set its rank to [k]. If it has
               some structure, we first traverse its sons, then set its rank to the
               maximum of their ranks. *)

       Every young variable whose rank has become strictly less than the
       current pool's number may be safely turned into an old variable. We do
       so by moving it into the previous pool. In fact, it would be safe to
       move it directly to the pool that corresponds to its rank. However, in
       the current implementation, we do not have all pools at hand, but only
       the previous pool.
